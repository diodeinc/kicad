## 3 Description

The REF6000 family of voltage references have an integrated low output impedance buffer that enable the user to directly drive the REF pin of precision data converters, while preserving linearity, distortion, and noise performance. Most precision SAR and Delta-Sigma ADCs, switch binary-weighted capacitors onto the REF pin during the conversion process. In order to support this dynamic load the output of the voltage reference must be buffered with a low-output impedance (high-bandwidth) buffer. The REF6000 family devices are well suited, but not limited, to drive the REF pin of the ADS88xx family of SAR ADCs, and ADS127xx family of delta-sigma ADCs, as well as other digital-to-analog converters (DACs).
The REF6000 family of voltage references are able to maintain an output voltage within 1LSB (18-bit) with minimal droop, even during the first conversion while driving the REF pin of the ADS8881. This feature is useful in burst-mode, event-triggered, equivalent-time sampling, and variable-sampling-rate data-acquisition systems. The REF60xx variants of REF6000 family specify a maximum temperature drift of just $5 \mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and initial accuracy of $0.05 \%$ for both the voltage reference and the low output impedance buffer combined. For various temperature drift options in REF6000 family, see the Device Comparison Table.

![img-22.jpeg](img-22.jpeg)# 8 Parameter Measurement Information 

### 8.1 Solder Heat Shift

The materials used in the manufacture of the REF60xx have differing coefficients of thermal expansion, and result in stress on the device die when the part is heated. Mechanical and thermal stress on the device die sometimes causes the output voltages to shift, degrading the initial accuracy specifications of the product. Reflow soldering is a common cause of this error.
In order to illustrate this effect, a total of 128 devices were soldered on eight printed circuit boards (PCBs), with 16 devices on each PCB, using lead-free solder paste, and the manufacturer-suggested reflow profile. The reflow profile is as shown in Figure 40. The printed circuit board is comprised of FR4 material. The board thickness is 1.65 mm and the area is $101.6 \mathrm{~mm} \times 127 \mathrm{~mm}$.

The reference output voltage is measured before and after the reflow process; the typical shift is displayed in Figure 41. Although all tested units exhibit very low shifts ( $<0.03 \%$ ), higher shifts are also possible depending on the size, thickness, and material of the PCB.
The histogram displays the typical shift for exposure to a single reflow profile. Exposure to multiple reflows, as is common on PCBs with surface-mount components on both sides, causes additional shifts in the output bias voltage. If the PCB is exposed to multiple reflows, solder the device in the final pass to minimize exposure to thermal stress.
![img-23.jpeg](img-23.jpeg)# 8.2 Thermal Hysteresis 

Thermal hysteresis for the device is defined as the change in output voltage after operating the device at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, cycling the device through the specified temperature range, and returning to $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Thermal hysteresis was measured with the REF60xx soldered to a PCB, similar to a real-world application. The PCB was baked at $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 minutes before thermal hysteresis was measured. Thermal hysteresis is expressed as:

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{HYST}}=\left(\frac{\left|\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{PRE}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{POST}}\right|}{\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{NOM}}}\right) \bullet 10^{6} \quad(\mathrm{ppm})
$$

where

- $\mathrm{V}_{\text {HYST }}=$ thermal hysteresis (in units of ppm).
- $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{NOM}}=$ the specified output voltage.
- $\mathrm{V}_{\text {PRE }}=$ output voltage measured at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ pretemperature cycling.
- $\mathrm{V}_{\text {POST }}=$ output voltage measured after the device has cycled from $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ through the specified temperature range of $-40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $125^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and returns to $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
Typical thermal hysteresis distribution is shown in Figure 42 and Figure 43.

Figure 43. Thermal Hysteresis Distribution (Cycle 2)# 8.3 Reference Droop Measurements 

Many applications, such as event-triggered and multiplexed data-acquisition systems, require the very first conversion of the ADC to have 18-bit or greater precision. These types of data-acquisition systems capture data in bursts, and are also called burst-mode, data-acquisition systems. Achieving 18-bit precision for the first sample is a very difficult using a conventional voltage reference because the voltage reference droop limits the accuracy of the first few conversions. The REF60xx have an integrated ADC drive buffer that makes sure the reference droop is less than 1 LSB at 18-bit precision when used with the ADS8881, even at full throughput. Figure 44 and Figure 45 show the REF60xx output voltage droop when driving the REF pin of the ADS8881 at positive and negative full-scale inputs, respectively.
![img-26.jpeg](img-26.jpeg)

Direct measurement of the reference droop to 18-bit accuracy can be a challenging process. Therefore, the plots in Figure 44 and Figure 45 were obtained by processing the output code of the ADC. The ADC output code is given by:

$$
\mathrm{C}=\left(\text { Input Voltage } / \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{REF}}\right) \times 2^{\mathrm{N}}
$$

If the input voltage is kept constant, $\mathrm{V}_{\text {REF }}$ is computed by monitoring the ADC output code C . The ADC code usually has six to seven LSBs of code spread due to the inherent noise of the ADC. In order to measure reference droop, this noise must be reduced drastically. Noise reduction is done by averaging the output code multiple times, as described in the next paragraph.# Reference Droop Measurements (continued) 

Figure 46 shows the setup that was used to measure the reference droop. The output ADC code was captured using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and post-processing was done on a personal computer. The input to the THS4521, and hence in turn to the ADS8881, is a constant dc voltage (close to positive or negative full-scale because this condition is the worst-case for charge drawn from the REF pin). The dc source must have extremely low noise. After the REF60xx device is powered up and stable, the FPGA sends commands to the ADS8881 to capture data in bursts. The ADS8881 is initially in idle mode for 100 ms . The FPGA then sends a command to the ADS8881 to perform 100 conversions at 1 MSPS. The ADC code corresponding to these 100 conversions (one burst of data) is stored as the first row in a $1000 \times 100$ dimensional array. This operation is repeated 1000 times, and the data corresponding to each burst is stored in a new row of the $1000 \times 100$ dimensional array. Finally, each column in this array is averaged to get a final data-set of 100 elements. This final data-set now has code spread that is much less than 1 LSB because most of the noise has now been removed through averaging. This data-set was plotted on a graph with $X$ axis = column number (each column number corresponds to $1 \mu \mathrm{~s}$ of time because the sampling rate is 1 MSPS ), and Y axis $=$ ADC output code to obtain reference-droop measurements.

Typical $0.1-\mathrm{Hz}$ to $10-\mathrm{Hz}$ voltage noise for the REF6025 is shown in Figure 47. The 1/f noise scales with output voltage, but remains $3 \mu \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{PP}} / \mathrm{V}$ for all the variants. Peak-to-peak noise measurement setup is shown in Figure 48.

### 9.1 Overview

Most SAR ADCs, and a few delta-sigma ADCs, switch binary-weighted capacitors onto the REF pin during the conversion process. The magnitude of the capacitance switched onto the REF pin during each conversion depends on the input signal to the ADC. If a voltage reference is directly connected to the REF pin of these ADCs, the reference voltage droops because of the dynamic input signal dependent load of the binary-weighted capacitors. Because the reference voltage droop now has input signal dependance, significant degradation in THD and linearity for the system occurs.

In order to support this dynamic load and preserve the ADC linearity, distortion and noise performance, the output of the voltage reference must be buffered with a low-output impedance (high-bandwidth) buffer. The REF60xx family of voltage references have an integrated low output impedance buffer that enables the user to directly drive the REF pin of a SAR ADC, while preserving ADC linearity and distortion. In addition, the total noise in the full bandwidth of the REF60xx is extremely low, thus preserving the noise performance of the ADC. Voltage-Reference Impact on Total Harmonic Distortion (SLYY097) correlates the effect of reference settling to ADC distortion, and how the REF60xx achieves lowest distortion with minimal components and lowest power consumption.

The output voltage of the REF60xx does not droop below 1 LSB (18-bit), even during the first conversion while driving the REF pin of the ADS8881. This feature is useful in burst-mode, event-triggered, equivalent-time sampling, and variable-sampling-rate data-acquisition systems. Functional Block Diagram shows a simplified schematic of the REF60xx.

### 9.2 Functional Block Diagram

![img-30.jpeg](img-30.jpeg)# 9.3 Feature Description 

### 9.3.1 Integrated ADC Drive Buffer

Many ADC data sheets specify a few microamps of average current draw from the REF pin. Almost all voltage references provide these few microamps of average current; but not all voltage references are practical for driving a high-resolution, high-throughput SAR ADC because the peak current drawn can be very high when the capacitors are switched on the REF pin. The worst-case demand for the voltage reference is during a burst-mode conversion, when the ADC is idle for a very long time, before a conversion is initiated, and the first sample converted is expected to be precise. Usually, a large capacitor is connected between the REF pin and ground pin (or sometimes between the REFP and REFM pins) of the ADC to smoothen the current load and reduce the burden on the voltage reference. The voltage reference must then be capable of providing the average current required to completely charge the reference capacitor, but without causing the reference voltage to droop significantly. Most voltage references lack the ability to completely charge the reference capacitor, and settle when the binary-weighted capacitors are being switched onto the REF pin because of the large output impedance. Usually, voltage references have output impedances in the range of 10's of ohms at frequencies higher than 100 Hz . The output voltage of the voltage reference must be buffered with a low output impedance (usually high bandwidth) amplifier to achieve excellent linearity and distortion performance.
The key amplifier specifications to be considered when designing a reference buffer for a high-precision ADC are: low offset, low drift, wide bandwidth, and low output impedance. While it is possible to select an amplifier that sufficiently meets all these requirements, the amplifier comes at a cost of excessive power consumption. For example, the OPA350 is a $38-\mathrm{MHz}$ bandwidth amplifier with a maximum offset of 0.5 mV , and low offset drift of 4 $\mu \mathrm{V} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, but consumes a quiescent current of 5.2 mA . This is because (from an amplifier design perspective) offset and drift are dc specifications, whereas bandwidth, low output impedance, and high capacitive drive capability are high-frequency specifications. Therefore, achieving all the performance in one amplifier requires power. However, a more efficient design to meet the low power budget is to use a composite reference buffer, which uses an amplifier with superior high-frequency specifications in the feedback loop of a dc precision amplifier to get the overall performance at much lower power consumption. Figure 49 shows such a composite amplifier design with the OPA333 (dc precision amplifier) and THS4281 (high-bandwidth amplifier). This reference buffer design requires three devices, and a large number of external components. This solution still consumes close to 2 mA of quiescent current.
![img-31.jpeg](img-31.jpeg)

Figure 49. Composite Amplifier Reference Buffer# Feature Description (continued) 

The REF60xx family of voltage references have an integrated low output impedance buffer (ADC drive buffer); therefore, there is no need for an external buffer while driving the REF pin of high-precision, high-throughput SAR ADCs, as shown in Figure 50. The ADC drive buffer of the REF60xx is capable of replenishing a charge of 70 pC on a $47-\mu \mathrm{F}$ capacitor in $1 \mu \mathrm{~s}$, without allowing the voltage on the capacitor to droop more than 1 LSB at 18-bit precision. The REF60xx are trimmed at multiple temperatures in production, achieving a max drift of just 5 $\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for both the voltage reference and the buffer combined, while operating at a typical quiescent current of $820 \mu \mathrm{~A}$. Figure 51 compares the output impedance of a regular voltage reference (REF20xx) and a voltage reference with integrated ADC drive buffer (REF60xx). Figure 52 compares the burst-mode, reference-settling performance of a regular voltage reference and the REF60xx.

### 9.3.2 Temperature Drift

The REF60xx family is designed for minimal drift error, defined as the change in output voltage over temperature. The drift is calculated using the box method, as described by the following equation:

$$
\text { Drift }=\left(\frac{\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{REF}(\mathrm{MAX})}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{REF}(\mathrm{MIN})}}{\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{REF}} \cdot \text { Temperature Range }}\right) \bullet 10^{6} \quad(\mathrm{ppm})
$$

### 9.3.3 Load Current

The REF6025, REF6030, REF6033 and REF6041 are specified to deliver current load of $\pm 4 \mathrm{~mA}$. The REF6045 is specified to deliver $\pm 3.5 \mathrm{~mA}$, and the REF6050 is specified to deliver $\pm 3 \mathrm{~mA}$. The REF60xx are protected from short circuits at the output by limiting the output short-circuit current.
The short-circuit current limit $\left(I_{S C}\right)$ of the REF60xx family of devices is adjusted by connecting a resistor $\left(R_{S S}\right)$ on the SS pin. The short-circuit current limit when the REF60xx device is sourcing current can be calculated as shown in Equation 4:

$$
\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{SC}}=\left(80^{*} 10^{-9}\right)^{*} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{SS}}+\left(3^{*} 10^{-3}\right)
$$

The short circuit current limit when the REF60xx device is sinking is calculated as shown in Equation 5:

$$
\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{SC}}=\left(115^{*} 10^{-9}\right)^{*} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{SS}}+\left(4.6^{*} 10^{-3}\right)
$$

The recommended output current of the REF60xx also depends on the resistor connected to the SS pin. The recommended output current (sourcing and sinking) for the REF6025, REF6030, REF6033 and REF6041 is given by Equation 6:

$$
\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{L}}=\left(31.25^{*} 10^{-9}\right)^{*} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{SS}}+\left(0.25^{*} 10^{-3}\right)
$$

The recommended output current (sourcing and sinking) for the REF6045 is given by Equation 7:

$$
\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{L}}=\left(27.08^{*} 10^{-9}\right)^{*} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{SS}}+\left(0.25^{*} 10^{-3}\right)
$$

The recommended output current (sourcing and sinking) for the REF6050 is given by Equation 8:

$$
\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{L}}=\left(23.75^{*} 10^{-9}\right)^{*} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{SS}}+\left(0.15^{*} 10^{-3}\right)
$$

The temperature of the device increases according to Equation 9:

$$
T_{J}=T_{A}+P_{D} \cdot R_{I J A}
$$

where:

- $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{J}}=$ junction temperature $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$.
- $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{A}}=$ ambient temperature $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$.
- $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{D}}=$ power dissipated $(\mathrm{W})$.
- $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{IJA}}=$ junction-to-ambient thermal resistance $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{W}\right)$.

The REF60xx maximum junction temperature must not exceed the absolute maximum rating of $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.# Feature Description (continued) 

### 9.3.4 Stability

The REF60xx family of voltage references are stable with output capacitor values ranging from $10 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ to $47 \mu \mathrm{~F}$. At a low output-capacitor value of $10 \mu \mathrm{~F}$, an effective series resistance (ESR) of $20 \mathrm{~m} \Omega$ to $100 \mathrm{~m} \Omega$ is required for stability; whereas, at a higher value of $47 \mu \mathrm{~F}$, an ESR of $5 \mathrm{~m} \Omega$ to $100 \mathrm{~m} \Omega$ is required. The shaded region in Figure 53 shows the stable region of operation for the REF60xx devices.
![img-34.jpeg](img-34.jpeg)

Figure 53. Stable Output Capacitor Range
A capacitor of value $1 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ is required at the FILT pin for stability and noise performance. A low ESR ( $5 \mathrm{~m} \Omega$ to 20 $\mathrm{m} \Omega$ ) is easily achieved by increasing the PCB trace length, thus eliminating the need for a discrete resistor. Higher values of ESR (greater than $20 \mathrm{~m} \Omega$, but lesser than $100 \mathrm{~m} \Omega$ ) can be intentionally added to increase the output bandwidth of the REF60xx. This higher ESR improves the transient performance of the REF60xx, but worsens noise performance because of increased bandwidth.

### 9.4 Device Functional Modes

When the EN pin of the REF60xx is pulled high, the device is in active mode. The device must be in active mode for normal operation.
To place the REF60xx into a shutdown mode, pull the ENABLE pin low. When in shutdown mode, the output of the device becomes high impedance and the quiescent current of the device reduces to $1 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ (typ). See the enable pin voltage parameter in the Electrical Characteristics table for logic high and logic low voltage levels.# 10 Applications and Implementation 

## NOTE

Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI's customers are responsible for determining suitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design implementation to confirm system functionality.

### 10.1 Application Information

Many applications, such as event-triggered and multiplexed data-acquisition systems, require the very first conversion of the ADC to have 18-bit or greater precision. These types of data acquisition systems capture data in bursts, and are also called burst-mode, data-acquisition systems. Achieving 18-bit precision for the first sample is very difficult using a conventional voltage reference because the voltage reference droop limits the accuracy of the first few conversions. Furthermore, variable-sampling-rate systems require that the gain error of the system does not vary with sampling rate. The primary objective of this design example is to demonstrate the lowest distortion and noise, burst-mode data-acquisition block with low power consumption, using an 18-bit SAR ADC operating at a throughput of 1 MSPS , for a $1-\mathrm{kHz}$, full-scale, pure sine-wave input.

3. $\mathrm{THD}<-120 \mathrm{~dB}$
4. Power consumption $<50 \mathrm{~mW}$
5. Throughput $=1$ MSPS# Typical Application (continued) 

### 10.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure

The data acquisition system shown in Figure 54 has three major contributors to the noise and accuracy in the system: the input driver, the reference with driver, and the data converter. Each analog block is carefully designed so that the data converter specifications limit the system specifications. The THS4551, a fully differential operational amplifier is used to drive the 18-bit ADC (ADS8881). The charge-kickback RC filter at the output of the THS4551 is used to reduce the charge kickback created by the opening and closing of the sampling switch inside the ADC. Design the RC filter so that the voltage at the sampling capacitor settles to 18-bit accuracy within the acquisition time of the ADC.
Data-acquisition systems require stable and accurate voltage references in order to perform the most accurate data conversion. The REF60xx family of voltage references have integrated an ADC drive buffer, and can therefore drive the REF pin of the ADS8881 directly, without the need for an external reference buffer. See the Integrated ADC Drive Buffer section for more details about reference-buffer requirements. Correct output capacitor selection for the REF60xx is very important in this design. The Stability section describes the ESR requirements of the output capacitor for stability and burst-mode requirements. A capacitance of $1 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ is connected to the FILT pin to reduce broadband noise of the REF60xx.

The REF60xx family of references have extremely low dropout voltage. The dropout specifications can be found in the Electrical Characteristics section. A minimum $0.1 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ decoupling capacitor must be connected between the VIN and GND_F pins of the REF60xx. A typical dropout voltage versus load is shown in Figure 61.

Figure 61. Dropout Voltage vs Load Current# 12 Layout 

### 12.1 Layout Guidelines

Figure 62 illustrates an example of a PCB layout for a data-acquisition system using the REF60xx. Some key considerations are:

- Connect low-ESR, $0.1-\mu \mathrm{F}$ ceramic bypass capacitors between the VIN pin and ground.
- Place the REF60xx output capacitor $\left(C_{L}\right)$ and the ADC as close to each other as possible.
- Run two separate traces between VOUT_F, VOUT_S and the output capacitor, as shown in Figure 62.
- Short the GND_F and GND_S pins with a solid plane, and extend this plane to connect to the output capacitor $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{L}}$, as shown in Figure 62.
- Use a solid ground plane to help distribute heat and reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise pickup.
- Place the external components as close to the device as possible. This configuration prevents parasitic errors (such as the Seebeck effect) from occurring.
- Do not run sensitive analog traces in parallel with digital traces. Avoid crossing digital and analog traces if possible, and only make perpendicular crossings when absolutely necessary.

${ }^{(1)}$ Status: For more details on status, see our product life cycle. ${ }^{(2)}$ Material type: When designated, preproduction parts are prototypes/experimental devices, and are not yet approved or released for full production. Testing and final process, including without limitation quality assurance, reliability performance testing, and/or process qualification, may not yet be complete, and this item is subject to further changes or possible discontinuation. If available for ordering, purchases will be subject to an additional waiver at checkout, and are intended for early internal evaluation purposes only. These items are sold without warranties of any kind. ${ }^{(3)}$ RoHS values: Yes, No, RoHS Exempt. See the TI RoHS Statement for additional information and value definition. ${ }^{(4)}$ Lead finish/Ball material: Parts may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width. ${ }^{(5)}$ MSL rating/Peak reflow: The moisture sensitivity level ratings and peak solder (reflow) temperatures. In the event that a part has multiple moisture sensitivity ratings, only the lowest level per JEDEC standards is shown. Refer to the shipping label for the actual reflow temperature that will be used to mount the part to the printed circuit board. ${ }^{(6)}$ Part marking: There may be an additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category of the part.

Multiple part markings will be inside parentheses. Only one part marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "-" will appear on a part. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire part marking for that device.
