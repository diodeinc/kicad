## 3 Description

The LM2576 series of regulators are monolithic integrated circuits that provide all the active functions for a step-down (buck) switching regulator, capable of driving 3-A load with excellent line and load regulation. These devices are available in fixed output voltages of $3.3 \mathrm{~V}, 5 \mathrm{~V}, 12 \mathrm{~V}, 15 \mathrm{~V}$, and an adjustable output version.

Requiring a minimum number of external components, these regulators are simple to use and include fault protection and a fixed-frequency oscillator.

The LM2576 series offers a high-efficiency replacement for popular three-terminal linear regulators. It substantially reduces the size of the heat sink, and in some cases no heat sink is required.

A standard series of inductors optimized for use with the LM2576 are available from several different manufacturers. This feature greatly simplifies the design of switch-mode power supplies.

Other features include a $\pm 4 \%$ tolerance on output voltage within specified input voltages and output load conditions, and $\pm 10 \%$ on the oscillator frequency. External shutdown is included, featuring $50-\mu \mathrm{A}$ (typical) standby current. The output switch includes cycle-by-cycle current limiting, as well as thermal shutdown for full protection under fault conditions.

The LM76003 requires very few external components and has a pinout designed for simple, optimum PCB layout for EMI and thermal performance. See the device comparison table to compare specs.

### 7.1 Overview

The LM2576 SIMPLE SWITCHER® power converter regulator is an easy-to-use, non-synchronous step-down DC-DC converter with a wide input voltage range from 40 V to up to 60 V for a HV version. It is capable of delivering up to 3-A DC load current with excellent line and load regulation. These devices are available in fixed output voltages of $3.3 \mathrm{~V}, 5 \mathrm{~V}, 12 \mathrm{~V}, 15 \mathrm{~V}$, and an adjustable output version. The family requires few external components, and the pin arrangement was designed for simple, optimum PCB layout.

### 7.3 Feature Description

### 7.3.1 Undervoltage Lockout

In some applications it is desirable to keep the regulator off until the input voltage reaches a certain threshold. Figure 7-1 shows an undervoltage lockout circuit that accomplishes this task, while Figure 7-2 shows the same circuit applied to a buck-boost configuration. These circuits keep the regulator off until the input voltage reaches a predetermined level.

# 7.3.2 Delayed Start-Up 

The $\overline{O N} /$ OFF pin can be used to provide a delayed start-up feature as shown in Figure 7-3. With an input voltage of 20 V and for the part values shown, the circuit provides approximately 10 ms of delay time before the circuit begins switching. Increasing the RC time constant can provide longer delay times. But excessively large RC time constants can cause problems with input voltages that are high in $60-\mathrm{Hz}$ or $120-\mathrm{Hz}$ ripple, by coupling the ripple into the $\overline{O N} /$ OFF pin.

### 7.3.3 Adjustable Output, Low-Ripple Power Supply

Figure 7-4 shows a 3-A power supply that features an adjustable output voltage. An additional LC filter that reduces the output ripple by a factor of 10 or more is included in this circuit.![img-22.jpeg](img-22.jpeg)

# 7.4 Device Functional Modes 

### 7.4.1 Shutdown Mode

The $\overline{O N} / O F F$ pin provides electrical ON and OFF control for the LM2576. When the voltage of this pin is higher than 1.4 V , the device is in shutdown mode. The typical standby current in this mode is $50 \mu \mathrm{~A}$.

### 7.4.2 Active Mode

When the voltage of the $\overline{O N} / O F F$ pin is below 1.2 V , the device starts switching, and the output voltage rises until it reaches the normal regulation voltage.

### 7.4.3 Current Limit

The LM2576 device has current limiting to prevent the switch current from exceeding safe values during an accidental overload on the output. This current limit value can be found in Section 6.10 under the heading of $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{CL}}$.

The LM2576 uses cycle-by-cycle peak current limit for overload protection. This helps to prevent damage to the device and external components. The regulator operates in current limit mode whenever the inductor current exceeds the value of $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{CL}}$ given in Section 6.10. This occurs if the load current is greater than 3 A , or the converter is starting up. Keep in mind that the maximum available load current depends on the input voltage, output voltage, and inductor value. The regulator also incorporates short-circuit protection to prevent inductor current run-away. When the voltage on the FB pin (ADJ) falls below about 0.58 V the switching frequency is dropped to about 11 kHz . This allows the inductor current to ramp down sufficiently during the switch OFF-time to prevent saturation.# 8 Application and Implementation 

## Note

Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI's customers are responsible for determining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design implementation to confirm system functionality.

### 8.1 Application Information

### 8.1.1 Input Capacitor $\left(C_{\text {IN }}\right)$

To maintain stability, the regulator input pin must be bypassed with at least a $100-\mu \mathrm{F}$ electrolytic capacitor. The capacitor leads must be kept short, and placed near the regulator.

If the operating temperature range includes temperatures below $-25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the input capacitor value can need to be larger. With most electrolytic capacitors, the capacitance value decreases and the ESR increases with lower temperatures and age. Paralleling a ceramic or solid tantalum capacitor increases the regulator stability at cold temperatures. For maximum capacitor operating lifetime, the RMS ripple current rating of the capacitor must be greater than:

$$
1.2\left(\frac{\mathrm{t}_{\mathrm{ON}}}{\mathrm{~T}}\right)\left(1_{\mathrm{LOAD}}\right)
$$

Where for a buck regulator:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{t}_{\mathrm{ON}}}{\mathrm{~T}}=\frac{\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{OUT}}}{\mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{IN}}}
$$

Where for a buck-boost regulator:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{t}_{\mathrm{ON}}}{\mathrm{~T}}=\frac{\mid \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{OUT}} \mid}{\mid \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{OUT}} \mid+\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{IN}}}
$$

### 8.1.2 Inductor Selection

All switching regulators have two basic modes of operation: continuous and discontinuous. The difference between the two types relates to the inductor current, whether it is flowing continuously, or if it drops to zero for a period of time in the normal switching cycle. Each mode has distinctively different operating characteristics, which can affect the regulator performance and requirements.

The LM2576 (or any of the SIMPLE SWITCHER power converter family can be used for both continuous and discontinuous modes of operation.

The inductor value selection guides in Figure 8-4 through Figure 8-8 are designed for buck regulator designs of the continuous inductor current type. When using inductor values shown in the inductor selection guide, the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current is approximately $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ of the maximum DC current. With relatively heavy load currents, the circuit operates in the continuous mode (inductor current always flowing), but under light load conditions, the circuit is forced to the discontinuous mode (inductor current falls to zero for a period of time). This discontinuous mode of operation is perfectly acceptable. For light loads (less than approximately 300 mA ), it can be desirable to operate the regulator in the discontinuous mode, primarily because of the lower inductor values required for the discontinuous mode.

The selection guide chooses inductor values suitable for continuous mode operation, but if the inductor value chosen is prohibitively high, the designer must investigate the possibility of discontinuous operation.

Inductors are available in different styles such as pot core, toriod, E-frame, bobbin core, and so on, as well as different core materials, such as ferrites and powdered iron. The bobbin core is the least expensive type, and consists of wire wrapped on a ferrite rod core. This type of construction makes for an inexpensive inductor; however, because the magnetic flux is not completely contained within the core, the bobbin core generatesmore electromagnetic interference (EMI). This EMI can cause problems in sensitive circuits, or can give incorrect scope readings because of induced voltages in the scope probe.

The inductors listed in the selection chart include ferrite pot core construction for AIE, powdered iron toroid for Pulse Engineering, and ferrite bobbin core for Renco.

An inductor must not operate beyond its maximum-rated current because it can saturate. When an inductor begins to saturate, the inductance decreases rapidly, and the inductor begins to look mainly resistive (the DC resistance of the winding), causing the switch current to rise very rapidly. Different inductor types have different saturation characteristics, and this must be considered when selecting an inductor.

The inductor manufacturer's data sheets include current and energy limits to avoid inductor saturation.

# 8.1.3 Inductor Ripple Current 

When the switcher is operating in the continuous mode, the inductor current waveform ranges from a triangular to a sawtooth type of waveform (depending on the input voltage). For a given input voltage and output voltage, the peak-to-peak amplitude of this inductor current waveform remains constant. As the load current rises or falls, the entire sawtooth current waveform also rises or falls. The average DC value of this waveform is equal to the DC load current (in the buck regulator configuration).

If the load current drops to a low enough level, the bottom of the sawtooth current waveform reaches zero, and the switcher changes to a discontinuous mode of operation. This is a perfectly acceptable mode of operation. Any buck switching regulator (no matter how large the inductor value is) is forced to run discontinuous if the load current is light enough.

### 8.1.4 Output Capacitor

An output capacitor is required to filter the output voltage and is needed for loop stability. The capacitor must be placed near the LM2576 using short PCB traces. Standard aluminum electrolytics are usually adequate, but TI recommends low ESR types for low output ripple voltage and good stability. The ESR of a capacitor depends on many factors, including: the value, the voltage rating, physical size, and the type of construction. In general, low value or low voltage (less than 12 V ) electrolytic capacitors usually have higher ESR numbers.

The amount of output ripple voltage is primarily a function of the ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) of the output capacitor and the amplitude of the inductor ripple current $\left(\Delta I_{\text {IND }}\right)$. See Section 8.1.3.

The lower capacitor values ( $220 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ to $1000 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ ) allows typically 50 mV to 150 mV of output ripple voltage, while larger-value capacitors reduces the ripple to approximately 20 mV to 50 mV .

$$
\text { Output Ripple Voltage }=\left(\Delta I_{\text {IND }}\right)\left(\text { ESR of } C_{\text {OUT }}\right)
$$

To further reduce the output ripple voltage, several standard electrolytic capacitors can be paralleled, or a highergrade capacitor can be used. Such capacitors are often called high-frequency, low-inductance, or low-ESR. These reduces the output ripple to 10 mV or 20 mV . However, when operating in the continuous mode, reducing the ESR below $0.03 \Omega$ can cause instability in the regulator.

Tantalum capacitors can have a very low ESR, and must be carefully evaluated if it is the only output capacitor. Because of their good low temperature characteristics, a tantalum can be used in parallel with aluminum electrolytics, with the tantalum making up $10 \%$ or $20 \%$ of the total capacitance.

The ripple current rating of the capacitor at 52 kHz must be at least $50 \%$ higher than the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current.

### 8.1.5 Catch Diode

Buck regulators require a diode to provide a return path for the inductor current when the switch is off. This diode must be placed close to the LM2576 using short leads and short printed-circuit traces.

Because of their fast switching speed and low forward voltage drop, Schottky diodes provide the best efficiency, especially in low output voltage switching regulators (less than 5 V ). Fast-recovery, high-efficiency, or ultra-fast recovery diodes are also suitable, but some types with an abrupt turnoff characteristic can cause instability and EMI problems. A fast-recovery diode with soft recovery characteristics is a better choice. Standard $60-\mathrm{Hz}$diodes (for example, 1N4001 or 1N5400, and so on) are also not suitable. See Table 8-3 for Schottky and soft fast-recovery diode selection guide.

# 8.1.6 Output Voltage Ripple and Transients 

The output voltage of a switching power supply contains a sawtooth ripple voltage at the switcher frequency, typically about $1 \%$ of the output voltage, and can also contain short voltage spikes at the peaks of the sawtooth waveform.

The output ripple voltage is due mainly to the inductor sawtooth ripple current multiplied by the ESR of the output capacitor (see Section 8.1.2).

The voltage spikes are present because of the fast switching action of the output switch, and the parasitic inductance of the output filter capacitor. To minimize these voltage spikes, special low inductance capacitors can be used, and their lead lengths must be kept short. Wiring inductance, stray capacitance, as well as the scope probe used to evaluate these transients, all contribute to the amplitude of these spikes.

An additional small LC filter ( $20 \mu \mathrm{H}$ and $100 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ ) can be added to the output (as shown in Figure 7-4) to further reduce the amount of output ripple and transients. A $10 \times$ reduction in output ripple voltage and transients is possible with this filter.

### 8.1.7 Feedback Connection

The LM2576 (fixed voltage versions) feedback pin must be wired to the output voltage point of the switching power supply. When using the adjustable version, physically locate both output voltage programming resistors near the LM2576 to avoid picking up unwanted noise. Avoid using resistors greater than $100 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ because of the increased chance of noise pickup.

### 8.1.8 ON /OFF INPUT

For normal operation, the ON /OFF pin must be grounded or driven with a low-level TTL voltage (typically below 1.6 V ). To put the regulator into standby mode, drive this pin with a high-level TTL or CMOS signal. The ON /OFF pin can be safely pulled up to $+V_{\text {IN }}$ without a resistor in series with it. The ON /OFF pin must not be left open.

### 8.1.9 Inverting Regulator

Figure 8-1 shows a LM2576-12 in a buck-boost configuration to generate a negative 12-V output from a positive input voltage. This circuit bootstraps the ground pin of the regulator to the negative output voltage, then by grounding the feedback pin, the regulator senses the inverted output voltage and regulates it to -12 V .

For an input voltage of 12 V or more, the maximum available output current in this configuration is approximately 700 mA . At lighter loads, the minimum input voltage required drops to approximately 4.7 V .

The switch currents in this buck-boost configuration are higher than in the standard buck-mode design, thus lowering the available output current. Also, the start-up input current of the buck-boost converter is higher than the standard buck-mode regulator, and this can overload an input power source with a current limit less than 5 A. Using a delayed turn-on or an undervoltage lockout circuit (described in Section 8.1.10) can allow the input voltage to rise to a high enough level before the switcher can be allowed to turn on.

Because of the structural differences between the buck and the buck-boost regulator topologies, the buck regulator design procedure section can not be used to select the inductor or the output capacitor. The recommended range of inductor values for the buck-boost design is between $68 \mu \mathrm{H}$ and $220 \mu \mathrm{H}$, and the output capacitor values must be larger than what is normally required for buck designs. Low input voltages or high output currents require a large value output capacitor (in the thousands of micro Farads).
The peak inductor current, which is the same as the peak switch current, can be calculated in Equation 6:

$$
I_{p} \approx\left(\frac{I_{\text {LOAD }}\left(V_{\text {IN }}+|V_{\text {OUT }}\right|}{V_{\text {IN }}}+\frac{V_{\text {IN }} \mid V_{\text {OUT }}}{V_{\text {IN }}+|V_{\text {OUT }}|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2 L_{1} / \text { OSC }}\right)
$$

where $f_{\text {osc }}=52 \mathrm{kHz}$Under normal continuous inductor current operating conditions, the minimum $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{IN}}$ represents the worst case. Select an inductor that is rated for the peak current anticipated.
![img-24.jpeg](img-24.jpeg)

Figure 8-1. Inverting Buck-Boost Develops -12 V
Also, the maximum voltage appearing across the regulator is the absolute sum of the input and output voltage. For a -12-V output, the maximum input voltage for the LM2576 is +28 V , or +48 V for the LM2576HV.

# 8.1.10 Negative Boost Regulator 

Another variation on the buck-boost topology is the negative boost configuration. The circuit in Figure 8-2 accepts an input voltage ranging from -5 V to -12 V and provides a regulated -12-V output. Input voltages greater than -12 V causes the output to rise above -12 V , but does not damage the regulator.
![img-25.jpeg](img-25.jpeg)

Typical Load Current 400 mA for $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{IN}}=-5.2 \mathrm{~V} 750 \mathrm{~mA}$ for $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{IN}}=-7 \mathrm{~V}$ Heat sink can be required.

## Figure 8-2. Negative Boost

Because of the boosting function of this type of regulator, the switch current is relatively high, especially at low input voltages. Output load current limitations are a result of the maximum current rating of the switch. Also, boost regulators can not provide current-limiting load protection in the event of a shorted load, so some other means (such as a fuse) can be necessary.# 8.2 Typical Applications

### 8.2.1.2.2 Inductor Selection (L1)

1. Select the correct Inductor value selection guide from Figure 8-4, Figure 8-5, Figure 8-6, or Figure 8-7. (Output voltages of $3.3 \mathrm{~V}, 5 \mathrm{~V}, 12 \mathrm{~V}$ or 15 V respectively). For other output voltages, see the design procedure for the adjustable version. Use the selection guide shown in Figure 8-5.2. From the inductor value selection guide, identify the inductance region intersected by $\mathrm{V}_{\text {IN }}$ (Max) and $\mathrm{I}_{\text {LOAD }}$ (Max), and note the inductor code for that region. From the selection guide, the inductance area intersected by the $15-\mathrm{V}$ line and 3-A line is L 100 .
3. Identify the inductor value from the inductor code, and select an appropriate inductor from the table shown in Figure 8-4. Part numbers are listed for three inductor manufacturers. The inductor chosen must be rated for operation at the LM2576 switching frequency ( 52 kHz ) and for a current rating of $1.15 \times \mathrm{I}_{\text {LOAD }}$. For additional inductor information, see Section 8.1.2. Inductor value required is $100 \mu \mathrm{H}$ from the table in Figure 8-4. Choose AIE 415-0930, Pulse Engineering PE92108, or Renco RL2444.

# 8.2.1.2.3 Output Capacitor Selection ( $\mathrm{C}_{\text {OUT }}$ ) 

1. The value of the output capacitor together with the inductor defines the dominate pole-pair of the switching regulator loop. For stable operation and an acceptable output ripple voltage, (approximately $1 \%$ of the output voltage) TI recommends a value between $100 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ and $470 \mu \mathrm{~F}$. We choose $\mathrm{C}_{\text {OUT }}=680-\mu \mathrm{F}$ to $2000-\mu \mathrm{F}$ standard aluminum electrolytic.
2. The voltage rating of the capacitor must be at least 1.5 times greater than the output voltage. For a $5-\mathrm{V}$ regulator, a rating of at least 8 V is appropriate, and TI recommends a $10-\mathrm{V}$ or $15-\mathrm{V}$ rating. Capacitor voltage rating $=20 \mathrm{~V}$. Higher voltage electrolytic capacitors generally have lower ESR numbers, and for this reason it can be necessary to select a capacitor rated for a higher voltage than can normally be needed.

### 8.2.1.2.4 Catch Diode Selection (D1)

1. The catch-diode current rating must be at least 1.2 times greater than the maximum load current. Also, if the power supply design must withstand a continuous output short, the diode must have a current rating equal to the maximum current limit of the LM2576. The most stressful condition for this diode is an overload or shorted output condition. For this example, a 3-A current rating is adequate.
2. The reverse voltage rating of the diode must be at least 1.25 times the maximum input voltage. Use a $20-\mathrm{V}$ 1N5823 or SR302 Schottky diode, or any of the suggested fast-recovery diodes shown in Table 8-3.

### 8.2.1.2.5 Input Capacitor ( $\mathrm{C}_{\text {IN }}$ )

An aluminum or tantalum electrolytic bypass capacitor located close to the regulator is needed for stable operation. A $100-\mu \mathrm{F}, 25-\mathrm{V}$ aluminum electrolytic capacitor located near the input and ground pins provides sufficient bypassing.# 8.2.1.3 Application Curves

### 8.2.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure

### 8.2.2.2.1 Programming Output Voltage

Select R1 and R2, as shown in Figure 8-9.
Use Equation 7 to select the appropriate resistor values.

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{OUT}}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{REF}}\left(1+\frac{\mathrm{R}_{2}}{\mathrm{R}_{1}}\right) \text { where } \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{REF}}=1.23 \mathrm{~V}
$$

$R_{1}$ can be between 1 k and 5 k . (For best temperature coefficient and stability with time, use $1 \%$ metal film resistors)

$$
\mathrm{R}_{2}=\mathrm{R}_{1}\left(\frac{\mathrm{~V}_{\text {OUT }}}{\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{REF}}}-1\right)=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega\left(\frac{10 \mathrm{~V}}{1.23 \mathrm{~V}}-1\right) \text { Select } R_{1}=1 \mathrm{~K} \Omega
$$

$R_{2}=1 \mathrm{k}(8.13-1)=7.13 \mathrm{k}$, closest $1 \%$ value is 7.15 k

### 8.2.2.2.2 Inductor Selection (L1)

1. Calculate the inductor Volt $\cdot$ microsecond constant, $\mathrm{E} \cdot \mathrm{T}(\mathrm{V} \cdot \mu \mathrm{s})$, from Equation 9:
$E \times T=\left(V_{i N}-V_{\text {OUT }}\right) \frac{V_{\text {OUT }}}{V_{i N}} \times \frac{1000}{F(\text { in } k H z)}(V \times \mu s)$
Calculate $\mathrm{E} \cdot \mathrm{T}(\mathrm{V} \cdot \mu \mathrm{s})$$$
E \times T=(25-10) \times \frac{10}{25} \times \frac{1000}{52}=115 \mathrm{~V} \times \mu \mathrm{s}
$$

2. Use the $E \cdot T$ value from the previous formula and match it with the $E \cdot T$ number on the vertical axis of the Inductor value selection guide shown in Figure 8-8.
$E \cdot T=115 \mathrm{~V} \cdot \mu \mathrm{~s}$
3. On the horizontal axis, select the maximum load current.
$\mathrm{I}_{\text {LOAD }}(\mathrm{Max})=3 \mathrm{~A}$
4. Identify the inductance region intersected by the $E \cdot T$ value and the maximum load current value, and note the inductor code for that region.

Inductance Region $=$ H150
5. Identify the inductor value from the inductor code, and select an appropriate inductor from the table shown in Table 8-4. Part numbers are listed for three inductor manufacturers. The inductor chosen must be rated for operation at the LM2576 switching frequency ( 52 kHz ) and for a current rating of $1.15 \times \mathrm{I}_{\text {LOAD }}$. For additional inductor information, see Section 8.1.2.

Inductor Value $=150 \mu \mathrm{H}$
Choose from AIE part \#415-0936, Pulse Engineering part \#PE-531115, or Renco part \#RL2445.

# 8.2.2.2.3 Output Capacitor Selection ( $\mathrm{C}_{\text {OUT }}$ ) 

1. The value of the output capacitor together with the inductor defines the dominate pole-pair of the switching regulator loop. For stable operation, the capacitor must satisfy Equation 11:
$\mathrm{C}_{\text {OUT }} \geq 13,300 \frac{\mathrm{~V}_{\text {IN(Max) }}}{\mathrm{V}_{\text {OUT }} \times \mathrm{L}(\mu \mathrm{H})}(\mu \mathrm{F})$
Equation 11 yields capacitor values between $10 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ and $2200 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ that satisfies the loop requirements for stable operation. But to achieve an acceptable output ripple voltage, (approximately $1 \%$ of the output voltage) and transient response, the output capacitor can need to be several times larger than Equation 11 yields.
$\operatorname{COUT} \geq 13,300 \frac{25}{10 \times 150}=22.2 \mu \mathrm{~F}$
However, for acceptable output ripple voltage select
$\mathrm{C}_{\text {OUT }} \geq 680 \mu \mathrm{~F}$
$\mathrm{C}_{\text {OUT }}=680-\mu \mathrm{F}$ electrolytic capacitor
2. The capacitor voltage rating must be at last 1.5 times greater than the output voltage. For a $10-\mathrm{V}$ regulator, TI recommends a rating of at least 15 V or more. Higher voltage electrolytic capacitors generally have lower ESR numbers, and for this reason it can be necessary to select a capacitor rate for a higher voltage than can normally be needed.

### 8.2.2.2.4 Catch Diode Selection (D1)

1. The catch-diode current rating must be at least 1.2 times greater than the maximum load current. Also, if the power supply design must withstand a continuous output short, the diode must have a current rating equal to the maximum current limit of the LM2576. The most stressful condition for this diode is an overload or shorted output. See Table 8-3. For this example, a 3.3-A current rating is adequate.
2. The reverse voltage rating of the diode must be at least 1.25 times the maximum input voltage. Use a $30-\mathrm{V}$ 31DQ03 Schottky diode, or any of the suggested fast-recovery diodes in Table 8-3.# 8.2.2.2.5 Input Capacitor $\left(C_{\text {IN }}\right)$ 

An aluminum or tantalum electrolytic bypass capacitor located close to the regulator is needed for stable operation. A $100-\mu \mathrm{F}$ aluminum electrolytic capacitor located near the input and ground pins provides sufficient bypassing.

As in any switching regulator, layout is very important. Rapidly switching currents associated with wiring inductance generate voltage transients which can cause problems. For minimal inductance and ground loops, the length of the leads indicated by heavy lines must be kept as short as possible. Single-point grounding (as indicated) or ground plane construction must be used for best results. When using the adjustable version, physically locate the programming resistors near the regulator, to keep the sensitive feedback wiring short.

### 8.4 Layout

### 8.4.1 Layout Guidelines

Board layout is critical for the proper operation of switching power supplies. First, the ground plane area must be sufficient for thermal dissipation purposes. Second, appropriate guidelines must be followed to reduce the effects of switching noise. Switch mode converters are very fast switching devices. In such cases, the rapid increase of input current combined with the parasitic trace inductance generates unwanted L di/dt noise spikes. The magnitude of this noise tends to increase as the output current increases. This noise can turn into electromagnetic interference (EMI) and can also cause problems in device performance. Therefore, take care in layout to minimize the effect of this switching noise. The most important layout rule is to keep the AC current loops as small as possible. Figure 8-10 shows the current flow in a buck converter. The top schematic shows a dotted line which represents the current flow during the top-switch ON-state. The middle schematic shows the current flow during the top-switch OFF-state. The bottom schematic shows the currents referred to as AC currents. These AC currents are the most critical because they are changing in a very short time period. The dotted lines of the bottom schematic are the traces to keep as short and wide as possible. This also yields a small loop area reducing the loop inductance. To avoid functional problems due to layout, review the PCB layout example. Best results are achieved if the placement of the LM2576 device, the bypass capacitor, the Schottky diode, RFBB, RFBT, and the inductor are placed as shown in Figure 8-11.TI also recommends using 2-oz copper boards or heavier to help thermal dissipation and to reduce the parasitic inductances of board traces. See AN-1229 SIMPLE SWITCHER® PCB Layout Guidelines application report for more information.

Figure 8-11. LM2576xx Layout Example

# 8.4.3 Grounding 

To maintain output voltage stability, the power ground connections must be low-impedance (see Figure 8-3 and Figure 8-9). For the 5-lead TO-220 and DDPAK/TO-263 style package, both the tab and pin 3 are ground and either connection can be used, as they are both part of the same copper lead frame.

### 8.4.4 Heat Sink and Thermal Considerations

In many cases, only a small heat sink is required to keep the LM2576 junction temperature within the allowed operating range. For each application, to determine whether or not a heat sink is required, the following must be identified:

1. Maximum ambient temperature (in the application).
2. Maximum regulator power dissipation (in application).
3. Maximum allowed junction temperature $\left(125^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right.$ for the LM2576). For a safe, conservative design, a temperature approximately $15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ cooler than the maximum temperatures must be selected.
4. LM2576 package thermal resistances $\theta_{\mathrm{JA}}$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{JC}}$.

Total power dissipated by the LM2576 can be estimated in Equation 11:

$$
P_{D}=\left(V_{I N}\right)\left(I_{Q}\right)+\left(V_{O} / V_{I N}\right)\left(I_{L O A D}\right)\left(V_{S A T}\right)
$$

where

- $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Q}}$ (quiescent current) and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SAT}}$ can be found in Section 6.11 shown previously,
- $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{IN}}$ is the applied minimum input voltage, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ is the regulated output voltage,- and $\mathrm{I}_{\text {LOAD }}$ is the load current.

The dynamic losses during turnon and turnoff are negligible if a Schottky type catch diode is used.
When no heat sink is used, the junction temperature rise can be determined by Equation 12:

$$
\Delta T_{J}=\left(P_{D}\right)\left(\theta_{J A}\right)
$$

To arrive at the actual operating junction temperature, add the junction temperature rise to the maximum ambient temperature.

$$
T_{J}=\Delta T_{J}+T_{A}
$$

If the actual operating junction temperature is greater than the selected safe operating junction temperature determined in step 3, then a heat sink is required.
When using a heat sink, the junction temperature rise can be determined by Equation 13:

$$
\Delta T_{J}=\left(P_{D}\right)\left(\theta_{J C}+\theta_{\text {interface }}+\theta_{\text {Heat sink }}\right)
$$

The operating junction temperature is:

$$
T_{J}=T_{A}+\Delta T_{J}
$$

As in Equation 15, if the actual operating junction temperature is greater than the selected safe operating junction temperature, then a larger heat sink is required (one that has a lower thermal resistance).# 9 Device and Documentation Support

BUCK REGULATOR
BUCK-BOOST
REGULATOR
DUTY CYCLE (D)

A switching regulator topology in which a higher voltage is converted to a lower voltage. Also known as a step-down switching regulator.
A switching regulator topology in which a positive voltage is converted to a negative voltage without a transformer.
Ratio of the output switch on-time to the oscillator period. For buck regulator:

$$
\mathrm{D}=\frac{\mathrm{t}_{\mathrm{ON}}}{\mathrm{~T}}=\frac{\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{OUT}}}{\mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{IN}}}
$$

For buck-boost regulator:

CAPACITOR
EQUIVALENT SERIES RESISTANCE (ESR)

The diode which provides a return path for the load current when the LM2576 switch is OFF.

The proportion of input power actually delivered to the load.

$$
\eta=\frac{P_{\text {OUT }}}{P_{\text {IN }}}=\frac{P_{\text {OUT }}}{P_{\text {OUT }}+P_{\text {LOSS }}}
$$

The purely resistive component of a real capacitor impedance (see Figure 9-1). It causes power loss resulting in capacitor heating, which directly affects the capacitor operating lifetime. When used as a switching regulator output filter, higher ESR values result in higher output ripple voltages.

Figure 9-1. Simple Model of a Real Capacitor
Most standard aluminum electrolytic capacitors in the $100 \mu \mathrm{~F}-1000 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ range have $0.5 \Omega$ to $0.1 \Omega$ ESR. Higher-grade capacitors (low-ESR, high-frequency, or lowinductance) in the $100 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ to $1000 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ range generally have ESR of less than $0.15 \Omega$.

## STANDBY

QUIESCENT
CURRENT ( $\left.\mathrm{I}_{\text {STBY }}\right)$
INDUCTOR RIPPLE CURRENT ( $\Delta \mathrm{I}_{\text {IND }}$ )

The pure inductance component of a capacitor (see Figure 9-1). The amount of inductance is determined to a large extent on the capacitor construction. In a buck regulator, this unwanted inductance causes voltage spikes to appear on the output.
The AC component of the switching regulator output voltage. It is usually dominated by the output capacitor ESR multiplied by the inductor ripple current ( $\Delta \mathrm{I}_{\text {IND }}$ ). The peak-topeak value of this sawtooth ripple current can be determined by reading Section 8.1.3.
RMS value of the maximum allowable alternating current at which a capacitor can be operated continuously at a specified temperature.
Supply current required by the LM2576 when in the standby mode ( $\overline{\mathrm{ON}}$ /OFF pin is driven to TTL-high voltage, thus turning the output switch OFF).

The peak-to-peak value of the inductor current waveform, typically a sawtooth waveform when the regulator is operating in the continuous mode (vs. discontinuous mode).CONTINUOUS/
DISCONTINUOUS MODE OPERATION

INDUCTOR SATURATION

OPERATING VOLT MICROSECOND CONSTANT ( $\mathrm{E}+\mathrm{T}_{\text {op }}$ )

Relates to the inductor current. In the continuous mode, the inductor current is always flowing and never drops to zero, vs. the discontinuous mode, where the inductor current drops to zero for a period of time in the normal switching cycle.
The condition which exists when an inductor cannot hold any more magnetic flux. When an inductor saturates, the inductor appears less inductive and the resistive component dominates. Inductor current is then limited only by the DC resistance of the wire and the available source current.
The product (in Volt $\cdot \mu \mathrm{s}$ ) of the voltage applied to the inductor and the time the voltage is applied. This $\mathrm{E} \cdot \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{op}}$ constant is a measure of the energy handling capability of an inductor and is dependent upon the type of core, the core area, the number of turns, and the duty cycle.

${ }^{(1)}$ Status: For more details on status, see our product life cycle. ${ }^{(2)}$ Material type: When designated, preproduction parts are prototypes/experimental devices, and are not yet approved or released for full production. Testing and final process, including without limitation quality assurance, reliability performance testing, and/or process qualification, may not yet be complete, and this item is subject to further changes or possible discontinuation. If available for ordering, purchases will be subject to an additional waiver at checkout, and are intended for early internal evaluation purposes only. These items are sold without warranties of any kind. ${ }^{(3)}$ RoHS values: Yes, No, RoHS Exempt. See the TI RoHS Statement for additional information and value definition. ${ }^{(4)}$ Lead finish/Ball material: Parts may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width. ${ }^{(5)}$ MSL rating/Peak reflow: The moisture sensitivity level ratings and peak solder (reflow) temperatures. In the event that a part has multiple moisture sensitivity ratings, only the lowest level per JEDEC standards is shown. Refer to the shipping label for the actual reflow temperature that will be used to mount the part to the printed circuit board. ${ }^{(6)}$ Part marking: There may be an additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category of the part.

Multiple part markings will be inside parentheses. Only one part marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "-" will appear on a part. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire part marking for that device.
