"""WS2812B - Intelligent RGB LED with integrated controller

The WS2812B is an intelligent control LED light source that integrates control circuit 
and RGB chip in a single 5050 package. Each LED contains an intelligent digital port 
data latch and signal reshaping amplification drive circuit, along with a precision 
internal oscillator and programmable constant current control. The LED uses single-wire 
NZR communication at 800 Kbps and can be cascaded with automatic signal reshaping. 
Each pixel provides 24-bit color (8 bits per channel) for 16.7 million colors total.

Key features:
- Single-wire digital control interface
- 5V operation (4.5-5.5V operating range)
- 256 brightness levels per color channel
- Cascade-able design with automatic signal reshaping
- Built-in electric reset and power-lost reset circuits
- Data transmission rate: 800 Kbps
- Maximum cascade distance between LEDs: 5 meters
